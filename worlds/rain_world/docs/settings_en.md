# Rain World player settings

The meanings and implications of the more nuanced player settings are discussed here.

### Passage progress without Survivor
`Passage progress without Survivor` (PPWS) is a setting in the Rain World Remix settings
which affects when The Dragon Slayer, The Friend, and The Wanderer can be earned.
Enabling PPWS makes it possible to earn these passages without first earning The Survivor.

### Victory condition
The default victory condition, ascension, logically requires raising max karma to 10
and accessing Subterranean (or, for Saint, Rubicon).
The alternate victory condition varies with slugcat, and is only applicable if MSC is enabled.
- **Monk and Survivor**: Reach Journey's End in Outer Expanse.
- **Gourmand**: Receive the Mark, meet Five Pebbles, and reach Journey's End in Outer Expanse.
- **Artificer**: Receive the Mark, meet Five Pebbles, and kill the Chieftain in Metropolis.
- **Rivulet**: Receive the Mark, receive the Rarefaction Cell and deliver it to Submerged Superstructure, 
then reunite with Looks to the Moon.
- **Spearmaster**: Receive the Mark, receive Spearmaster's unique pearl, have the pearl rewritten,
then deliver it to Communications Array in Sky Islands.
- **All other slugcats, or MSC disabled**: No alternate victory condition.

### Extra karma cap increases
How many extra karma cap items are placed into the pool.
When set to `0`, there are exactly enough karma items to raise max karma to 10,
regardless of the selected victory condition.
