# Rain World items

### Progression and useful items
Randomization adds the following _unique items_ to the pool,
meaning that these items will not necessarily appear in their normal locations.
For instance, echoes do not necessarily increase karma,
and completing a passage does not necessarily award a fast-travel token.

### Filler
Randomization adds the following filler items to the pool:
- Several vanilla weapons
(rocks, spears, explosive spears, grenades, flashbangs, sporepuffs, and cherrybombs)
- Several vanilla foods
(blue fruit, bubble fruit, eggbug eggs, jellyfish, mushrooms, slime mold)
- A few other types of items (karma flowers, vulture masks, lanterns)
- Several MSC weapons, if enabled (electric spears, lilypucks, singularity bombs, joke rifles)
- Several MSC foods, if enabled (firebug eggs, glow weed, gooieducks)

### Traps
Randomization adds the following trap items to the pool.
Although they are "traps," some of them can be exploited for personal gain (or are neutral).
The only thing that all traps have in common is that they affect the game world instantly.
- **Stun**: Slugcat is briefly stunned.
- **Creature**: a dangerous creature spawns in an adjacent room.
This may be a Red Lizard, Red Centipede, Spitter Spider, Brother Long Legs, or Daddy Long Legs.
The creature is immediately aware of Slugcat's position.
- **Timer**: the current cycle timer is shortened.
- **Zoomies**: Slugcat suddenly starts moving much faster.  The effect wears off after a short while.
- **Alarm**: every creature in the region is made aware of Slugcat's position.
- **Rain**: a heavy (but not crushing) rain suddenly starts and lasts a short while.
