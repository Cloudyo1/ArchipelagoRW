# Rain World items

### Unique
Randomization adds the following _unique items_ to the pool,
meaning that these items will not necessarily appear in their normal locations.
For instance, echoes do not necessarily increase karma,
and completing a passage does not necessarily award a token.
- Karma cap increases (at least 8)
- "Keys" for each accessible karma gate (unless gate behavior is set to karma only)
- Fast-travel tokens for each passage
- The Mark of Communication
- The neuron glow
- Hunter's green neuron fly / NSH slag key
- (MSC) The rarefaction cell for Rivulet
- (MSC) The unique data pearl for Spearmaster
- (MSC) Moon's message for Spearmaster's pearl
- (MSC) Artificer's citizen ID drone

### Filler
Randomization adds the following filler items to the pool:
- Several vanilla weapons
(rocks, spears, explosive spears, grenades, flashbangs, sporepuffs, and cherrybombs)
- Several vanilla foods
(blue fruit, bubble fruit, eggbug eggs, jellyfish, mushrooms, slime mold)
- Several MSC weapons, if enabled (electric spears, lilypucks, singularity bombs)
- Several MSC foods, if enabled (firebug eggs, glow weed, gooieducks)

### Traps
Randomization adds the following trap items to the pool.
Although they are "traps," some of them can be exploited for personal gain (or are neutral).
The only thing that all traps have in common is that they affect the game world instantly.
- **Stun**: Slugcat is briefly stunned.
- **Creature**: a dangerous creature spawns in an adjacent room.
This may be a Red Lizard, Red Centipede, Spitter Spider, a Vulture, or an Elite Scavenger.
The creature is immediately aware of Slugcat's position.
- **Timer**: the current cycle timer is shortened.
- **Zoomies**: Slugcat and/or creatures around them suddenly start moving much faster.
The effect wears off after entering a pipe.
- **Alarm**: every creature in the region is made aware of Slugcat's position.
