# Rain World location tracking

## Client tracker
A tracker appears on the pause menu in-game if the `Use gate map` option is enabled
in the `Base` tab of the Check Randomizer Remix settings.
Each region is represented by a node and each karma gate is represented by a connection between nodes.
The connections are bright once the key for that gate is obtained.
Hovering over a node displays an icon for each check in that region.
The icons are bright and colored once the check is collected.
Food quest and passages are under their own nodes.

## PopTracker
A PopTracker pack is maintained here:

## Universal Tracker
Rain World partially supports the Universal Tracker (UT).
To install it:
1. Download a release of UT [from GitHub](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases).
Rain World's compatibility with UT has been tested with UT v0.1.16RC1 and AP 0.6.0.
2. Place the `.apworld` into the `worlds` folder of your AP installation.

To use it in a multiworld:
1. Place your player YAML file in the `Players` folder of your AP installation.
2. Start the AP launcher.
3. In the right-hand column, scroll down and open the Universal Tracker.  A modified text client should open.
4. In this client, connect to the multiworld room. 

## Interactive map
