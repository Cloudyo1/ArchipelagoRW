# Rain World location tracking

## Universal Tracker
Rain World partially supports the Universal Tracker (UT).
To install it:
1. Download a release of UT [from GitHub](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases).
Rain World's compatibility with UT has been tested with UT v0.1.16RC1 and AP 0.6.0.
2. Place the `.apworld` into the `worlds` folder of your AP installation.

To use it in a multiworld:
1. Place your player YAML file in the `Players` folder of your AP installation.
2. Start the AP launcher.
3. In the right-hand column, scroll down and open the Universal Tracker.  A modified text client should open.
4. In this client, connect to the multiworld room.
