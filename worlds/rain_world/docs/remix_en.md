# Remix settings for Rain World Randomizer

Rain World Remix must be enabled regardless of your settings.
If your `Game state` is not a vanilla state, then More Slugcats Expansion must be enabled.

The following Remix settings are **recommended**, but not required:
- Rain World Remix
  - **Key items on Passage:**  This makes the alternate victory conditions for Rivulet and Spearmaster easier.
  - **Key item tracking:**  This causes colored pearls to appear on the in-game map
  and respawns them if you lose them to a bottomless pit.
  Otherwise, it is possible to permanently lose a pearl for a campaign and softlock the multiworld.
  - **Monk extended breath:**  Some checks are significantly harder for Monk if this is disabled.
- More Slugcats Expansion
  - **Disable shelter failures:**  Checking this makes Rivulet's campaign significantly *more* difficult.
  Allowing precycle-only spawns also make some checks easier.

The following Remix settings are **ignored** because they are overridden by Randomizer:
- Rain World Remix
  - **Passage progress without Survivor:**  Overridden by the `Passage progress without Survivor` player YAML setting.
  See [the checks documentation](/tutorial/Rain%20World/remix/en#Passages) for details.
  - **Monk-style gates for all campaigns:**  Overriden by the `Gate behavior` player YAML setting.
  - **Hunter cycles** and **Hunter bonus cycles:**  Hunter's illness is absent while Randomizer is active.
